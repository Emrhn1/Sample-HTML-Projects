                [Intro]
                Yeah, it's my life (Hey, Hailie)
                In my own words, I guess
                
                [Verse 1]
                Have you ever loved someone so much you'd give an arm for?
                Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
                When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
                And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
                But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
                And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
                What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
                "Daddy, look what I made!" "Dad's gotta go catch a plane"
                "Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?"
                "I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
                <mark>Daddy's writin' a song, the song ain't gon' write itself</mark>
                I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself"
                Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
                And put hands on her mother who's a spittin' image of her
                That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
                Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby, ha
                
                [Chorus]
                <span style="background-color: aqua;">And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
                Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
                Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'</span>
                And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
                And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
                Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
                Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
                And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

                [Verse 2]
                I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
                She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
                "You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?"
                "Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more" "Daddy, you're lyin'
                You always say that, you always say, 'This is the last time'
                But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine"
                <mark>She's pilin' boxes in front of the door,</mark> tryna block it
                "Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!"
                Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
                It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it wit' ya"
                I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
                These fuckin' walls must be talkin' 'cause, man, I can hear 'em
                They're sayin', "You got one more chance to do right, and it's tonight
                Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late"
                And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
                It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on, and I'm singin'
                
                [Chorus]
                And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
                Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
                Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
                And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
                And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
                Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
                Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
                And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
                
                
                [Verse 3]
                Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
                The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
                I take a bow and "Thank you all for comin' out"
                They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
                I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
                "Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!"
                "But, baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?"
                "I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
                <mark>You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad </mark>
                And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
                That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
                I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'"
                "But, baby, wait!" "It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
                Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
                That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
                Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
                Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you, you will
                You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real"
                I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
                How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
                I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
                Put it to my brain, scream, "Die, Shady!", and pop it
                The sky darkens, my life flashes
                The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
                That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringing, there's birds singin'
                It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
                I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
                Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say
                
                
                [Chorus]
                And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
                Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
                Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
                And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
                And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
                Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
                Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
                And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
